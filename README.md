What is the store’s average days for a customer to pay based on the return date of the film and the payment date.  What is the customer’s average?  Show a list of customer names, store id, customer’s average day to pay, and store’s average day to pay.  Filter the results by customers that have an average days out greater than the stores average.  Order the results by the customer ID.   (Hint: stores have inventory, inventory have rentals, and rentals have payments.)  Please add the function NOW() and give it a column name of your first name and last name separated by a underscore (this should be the first output column).
