What is the store’s average days for a customer to pay based on the return date of the film and the payment date.  What is the customer’s average?  Show a list of customer names, store id, customer’s average day to pay, and store’s average day to pay.  Filter the results by customers that have an average days out greater than the stores average.  Order the results by the customer ID.   (Hint: stores have inventory, inventory have rentals, and rentals have payments.)  Please add the function NOW() and give it a column name of your first name and last name separated by a underscore (this should be the first output column).


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
